# OSOCR-News
Hi community,

We are going to make a new multi-lingual OSOCR benchmark set. 

We want to collect some ideas for the language list that people may want to recognize.

If you have a specific language in mind, please open an issue. We will pick some of the suggested languages to collect data and annotate.
